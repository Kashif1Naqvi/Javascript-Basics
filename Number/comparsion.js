===   check eqality
==    check approximately eqality
>     check greate value
<     check less than value
>=    check greater than with also equal to value
<=    check less than with eqal to value
!     bang operator work in the sense of not
!=    not eqal to the require functionality or variable

so let's started implemetaion of the code
